subtitle:
  Our present research activities focus on non-equilibrium processes, which range from heterogeneous catalysis to thermal energy transport and conversion in complex systems. We combine traditional all-atom molecular dynamics, electronic structure theory, and rare events techniques, toward a comprehensive theoretical approach able to cover several time and length scales.

      ATMOSPHERIC ICE
    description:
      "Starting from a previously characterized ice model, we use a multiscale-multimodel approach to characterize the solvation shell of organic molecules at the air-ice interface. The absorption spectra of those molecules is then calculated using TDDFT on smaller models extracted from first-principles MD simulations"
