subtitle:
  We perform molecular simulations of nonequilibrium processes, which range from pump-probe spectroscopy to thermal energy transport and conversion in complex systems. We combine traditional all-atom molecular dynamics, electronic structure theory, and rare events techniques, toward a comprehensive theoretical approach able to cover several time and length scales.
