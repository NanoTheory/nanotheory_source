subtitle:
  Our present research activities focus on non-equilibrium processes, which range from heterogeneous catalysis to thermal energy transport and conversion in complex systems. We combine traditional all-atom molecular dynamics, electronic structure theory, and rare events techniques, toward a comprehensive theoretical approach able to cover several time and length scales.
